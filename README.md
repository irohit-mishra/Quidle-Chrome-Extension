**Quidle** is a minimalist Chrome extension that automatically closes inactive tabs, helping you focus and save memory no more tab clutter!


## 🔍 Features

- 🕐 **Auto-close inactive tabs** after a custom idle time
- ⚙️ **Smart exceptions**: Keep important sites open
- 🔒 **Privacy-first**: No tracking, no data collection
- 💾 **Tab Count**: Tells you the Number of Open Tabs
- ⚡ **Lightweight background service** using Manifest V3

## 📦 Install Now

➡️ [**Install from the Chrome Web Store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quidle/bknegggfpladncmbjldhdiiojojihpnl)

> Click “Add to Chrome” and let Quidle quietly clean up your browser life.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Set your preferred idle time (e.g., 15 mins).
2. Quidle monitors tab activity.
3. Tabs that sit idle are auto-closed (unless whitelisted).
4. More focus, less chaos.
5. And Much More

> ✨ Ideal for devs, students, digital nomads, and tab hoarders.
